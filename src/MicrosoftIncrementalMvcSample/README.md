This sample uses Microsoft's ASP.NET OAuth 2 middleware to authenticate the user and to get authorization from the user to access their classes, and [Google APIs Client Library for .NET](https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/dotnet) to use Google Services.

All of the interesting code is in Startup.cs and HomeController.cs.
